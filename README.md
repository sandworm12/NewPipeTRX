## What is this?

**NewPipe X** is a [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe) fork that continues to develop the original (pre-[rewrite](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/discussions/10118)) codebase.

### Go on...

The upstream NewPipe project has decided to undertake a [major rewrite effort](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/discussions/10118), for which they will be halting feature development for the foreseeable future.

**NewPipe X** offers the converse - continuing development on the original codebase rather than entirely rewriting it - to provide users with an alternative where functionality can continue to expand and improve.

**NewPipe X** originally began as a project to revive the discontinued [NewPipe SponsorBlock](https://github.com/polymorphicshade/NewPipe) project, so it already includes (optional) [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) and [Return YouTube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com/) functionality.

However, while its predecessor kept its scope limited to a couple of features, **NewPipe X** will consider any kind of functionality for implementation.
